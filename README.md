# BitcoinGenie
A program in Python that Linear,
Polynomial and Radio Basis Function models. Written in Python 2.7 

# You need to install the following: 
1. numpy - to preforme calculations on data. 
2. scikit-learn - to build a predictive model.
3. matplotlib - to plot the graph. 
4. scipy - to avoid the import error.


You will also need the CSV library but that is a built-in library, so you won't worry about that. The CSV file I used was the Bitcoin prices from late August 2017 until January 13.  
There are comments and docstrings in my code to illustrate how the program produces the price prediction.
